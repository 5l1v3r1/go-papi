go-papi
=======

Description
-----------

go-papi provides a Go interface to PAPI, the [Performance Application Programming Interface](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/).  PAPI provides convenient access to hardware performance counters, primarily those provided by the CPU but with others (e.g., various networks) also available.

As the [PAPI(3) man page](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/PAPIC:PAPI.3) explains, the PAPI API is split into "high level" and "low level" functions, with the former being simpler to use but less flexible and the latter providing finer-grained control over the sets of data measured and reported.

Installation
------------

Installation is a bit of a pain, as the new [`go`](http://weekly.golang.org/cmd/go/) tool doesn't yet handle custom `Makefile`s such as the one `go-papi` requires.  (This requirement is due to some of `go-papi`'s source files being generated automatically by a Perl script.)

First, download `go-papi` into your Go build tree without automatically building/installing it:

```
go get -d -v github.com/lanl/go-papi
```

Set the `PAPI_INCDIR` environment variable to the directory containing `papi.h`.  Also, ensure that the directory containing `libpapi.so` is listed in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Next, switch to the `go-papi` directory and build/test/install the package:

```
cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/lanl/go-papi
make
make check
make install
```

It is then safe to do a `make clean` to remove all of the byproducts of the installation process.

Documentation
-------------

Pre-built documentation for the core part of the go-papi API is available online at http://godoc.org/github.com/lanl/go-papi.  Unfortunately, the online documentation omits descriptions of all constants, variables, etc. that are generated during the build process, specifically the list of PAPI events (`papi-event.go`), event modifiers (`papi-emod.go`), and error values (`papi-errno.go`).

Once you install go-papi, you can view the complete go-papi API with [`godoc`](http://golang.org/cmd/godoc/), for example by running

```
godoc -http=:6060 -index
```

to start a local Web server then viewing the documentation at <http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/lanl/go-papi/> in your favorite browser.

For code examples, take a look at the `*_test.go` files in the go-papi source distribution.  `papi_hl_test.go` utilizes PAPI's high-level API; `papi_ll_test.go` utilizes PAPI's low-level API; and `papi_test.go` utilizes a few miscellaneous functions.
